      <p>
        I am a research assistant for Frances Moore, where I work on modeling public opinion on climate change with a focus on feedback loops from weather, the economy, and social groups. I recently graduated from the University of California, Davis, where I completed my B.S. in Environmental Policy, Analysis, and Planning.

        During my time at UC Davis, I developed passion and respect for quantitative methods and the research process. Through graduate methods courses, I learned and applied machine learning, causal inference, and text-as-data methods. Beyond classes, I worked on several research projects ranging from studying cleavages among groups within the Democratic party to developing novel methods for measuring climate attitudes. I am eager to put the skills I have learned into new pursuits.
